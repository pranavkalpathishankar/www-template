  - title: "Remove undefined behavior from tests"
    description: |
      Many of LLVM's unit tests have been reduced automatically from larger tests. Previous-generation reduction tools used undef and poison as placeholders everywhere, as well as introduced undefined behavior (UB). Tests with UB are not desirable because 1) they are fragile since in the future the compiler may start optimizing more aggressively and break the test, and 2) it breaks translation validation tools such as Alive2 (since it's correct to translate a function that is always UB into anything).

      The major steps include:

      1. Replace known patterns such as branch on undef/poison, memory accesses with invalid pointers, etc with non-UB patterns.
      2. Use Alive2 to detect further patterns (by searching for tests that are always UB).
      3. Report any LLVM bug found by Alive2 that is exposed when removing UB.
    expected_result: "The majority of LLVM's unit tests will be free of UB."
    skills: "Experience with scripting (Python or PHP) is required. Experience with regular expressions is encouraged."

  - title: "Automatically generate TableGen file for SPIR-V instruction set"
    description: |
      The existing file that describes the SPIR-V instruction set in LLVM was manually created and is not always complete or up to date. Whenever new instructions need to be added to the SPIR-V backend, the file must be amended. In addition, since it is not created in a systematic way, there are often slight discrepancies between how an instruction is described in the SPIR-V spec and how it is declared in the TableGen file.

      This project proposes creating a script capable of generating a complete TableGen file that describes the SPIR-V instruction set given the JSON grammar available in the KhronosGroup/SPIRV-Headers repository, and updating SPIR-V backend code to use the new definitions.
    expected_result: |
      1. The SPIR-V instruction set's definition in TableGen is replaced with autogenerated content.
      2. A script and documentation are provided to regenerate definitions from the JSON grammar.
      3. SPIR-V backend is updated to use new autogenerated definitions.
    skills: "Experience with scripting and intermediate knowledge of C++. Previous experience with LLVM/TableGen is a bonus but not required."

  - title: "LLVM bitstream integration with CAS (content-addressable storage)"
    description: |
      The LLVM bitstream file format is used for serialization of intermediate compiler artifacts, such as LLVM IR or Clang modules. This project aims to integrate the LLVM CAS library into the LLVM bitstream file format by factoring out frequently duplicated parts of bitstream files into separate CAS objects, reducing storage requirements.
    expected_result: |
      There's a way to configure the LLVM bitstream writer/reader to use CAS as the backing storage.
    skills: "Intermediate knowledge of C++, familiarity with data serialization, and self-motivation."

  - title: "Add 3-way comparison intrinsics"
    description: |
      3-way comparisons return -1, 0, or 1 based on whether values are lower, equal, or greater. The goal of this project is to implement new 3-way comparison intrinsics and improve optimization results by implementing legalization/expansion support in LLVM's backend and integrating them into the clang and rustc frontends.
    expected_result: |
      Full support for intrinsics in backend and optimization passes, ideally with frontend integration.

  - title: "Improve the LLVM.org Website Look and Feel"
    description: |
      The llvm.org website serves as the central hub for information about the LLVM project. Over time, the website has evolved organically, prompting the need for a redesign to enhance its modernity, structure, and ease of maintenance. This project aims to create a modern static website that improves navigation, taxonomy, and usability, reflecting the essence of LLVM.org.
    expected_result: |
      A modern, coherent website that improves navigation, content discoverability, mobile support, and accessibility. The project will involve community engagement to gather feedback and ensure a successful implementation.

  - title: "Out-of-process execution for clang-repl"
    description: |
      The Clang compiler supports various languages such as C, C++, ObjC, and ObjC++. Clang-Repl is an efficient interpreter that makes the C++ language more user-friendly, using the Orcv2 JIT infrastructure within the same process. However, this design has two significant drawbacks: it can't be used on devices with limited resources, and crashes in user code crash the entire process. This project aims to move Clang-Repl to an out-of-process execution model to address these issues.
    expected_result: |
      Implement out-of-process execution of statements with Clang-Repl.
      Demonstrate support for some ez-clang use cases.
      Research restart/continue approaches upon crashes.
      Stretch goal: Design versatile reliability approach for crash recovery.

  - title: "Support clang plugins on Windows"
    description: |
      Clang supports extending the compiler with plugins, enabling extra user-defined actions during compilation. While plugins work on Unix and Darwin, they are not supported on Windows due to platform differences. This project aims to expose the participant to a broad cross-section of the LLVM codebase, classifying APIs and implementing changes to support plugins on Windows.
    expected_result: |
      Implement clang plugin support on Windows.
      Extend the working prototype and the annotation tool.

  - title: "On Demand Parsing in Clang"
    description: |
      Clang currently parses a sequence of characters as they appear, linearly. However, most end-user code only uses a small portion of the entire translation unit. This project proposes an on-demand parsing approach where heavy compiling C++ entities are processed only when required. This approach aims to reduce peak memory usage and improve compile times for sparse translation units.
    expected_result: |
      Design and implement on-demand compilation for non-templated functions and classes.
      Run performance benchmarks on relevant codebases and prepare a report.
      Prepare a community RFC document.
      Stretch goal: Support templates.

  - title: "Improve Clang-Doc Usability"
    description: |
      Clang-Doc is a C/C++ documentation generation tool created as an alternative to Doxygen. While it can generate documentation in Markdown and HTML, it has usability issues, lacks support for some constructs, and doesn't scale well for large codebases. This project aims to improve Clang-Doc to the point where it can be used to generate documentation for large projects like LLVM.
    expected_result: |
      Improve usability of Clang-Doc and resolve existing limitations.
      Enable Clang-Doc to generate documentation for large codebases like LLVM.

  - title: "GPU Delta Debugging"
    description: |
      LLVM-reduce and similar tools perform delta debugging but are less useful if many implicit constraints exist. This project aims to develop a GPU-aware version, especially for execution time bugs, that can be used in conjunction with LLVM/OpenMP GPU-record-and-replay or a GPU loader script to minimize GPU test cases more efficiently and effectively.

  - title: "Offloading libcxx"
    description: |
      Modern C++ defines parallel algorithms as part of the standard library. This project aims to extend the implementation of these algorithms using OpenMP, including GPU offload where reasonable. The goal is to explore different algorithms and options for executing them on both the host and accelerator devices, especially GPUs, automatically via OpenMP.

  - title: "The 1001 thresholds in LLVM"
    description: |
      LLVM has many thresholds and flags to avoid costly cases, but it’s unclear if these thresholds are useful or their impact. This project aims to explore these thresholds, identify when they are hit, and assess how we should select their values and whether different profiles are needed.
