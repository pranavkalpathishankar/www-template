    description: |
      Once the most fast-paced part of the LLVM source tree, the MLIR project is slowing
      down significantly both in the amount and complexity of changes committed. The project had
      a few open meetings since the start of this year as opposed to more than a dozen the year
      before, 1183 commits tagged with "[mlir]" were made to the tree in the first seven months
      of 2024 as opposed to 2045 during the same period of 2023, etc. At the same time, the
      increasing amount of work is focused on downstream projects using MLIR, ranging from in-
      tree CIR and Flang, to incubated CIRCT and Polygeist, to out-of-tree OSS projects like
      IREE and XLA, to the many proprietary stacks. Are these the signs of MLIR reaching a
      certain maturity level? Or are these the warning signs of the worrying community
      disengagement? Should we declare MLIR feature-complete and redirect larger changes to
      client projects or, on the contrary, actively lift the common parts from downstreams? What
      is preventing individuals and teams from collaborating more actively in the open? This
      panel brings together leaders from academia, start-ups and established industry players to
      discuss their takes on these and other hot questions about MLIR strategy.
