  - title: "Revamping Sampling-Based PGO with Context-Sensitivity and Pseudo-Instrumentation "
    speaker: "Wenlei He"
    video_url: "https://youtu.be/HYJne9WjSd0"
    slides_url: "/devmtg/2024-04/slides/TechnicalTalks/He-Yu-Wang-Oh-RevampingSamplingBasedPGO.pdf"
    description: |
      This talk describes CSSPGO, a context-sensitive sampling-based PGO
      framework with pseudo-instrumentation. It leverages pseudo instrumentation
      to improve profile quality without incurring the overhead of traditional
      instrumentation. It also enriches profile with context-sensitivity to aid
      more effective optimizations through a novel profiling methodology using
      synchronized LBR and stack sampling. We will also share how CSSPGO is used
      to lift performance of Meta's server workloads.

  - title: "Deep Dive on MLIR Interfaces"
    speaker: "Mehdi Amini"
    video_url: "https://youtu.be/VCJAmOFvnh4"
    slides_url: "/devmtg/2024-04/slides/TechnicalTalks/Amini-DeepDiveOnMLIRInternals.pdf"
    description: |
      This talk will walk through the details of implementation of interfaces in
      MLIR. The interfaces (OpInterfaces, DialectInterfaces, TypeInterfaces, and
      AttributeInterfaces) are key components of MLIR extensibility. They are
      composed of a convenient user API through ODS (TableGen) as well as C++
      wrappers. However, there are many layers of indirection underlying their
      implementation, which are quite difficult to grasp with. It is a common
      complaint that it is impossible to debug or trace the code and understand
      how everything is fitting together.
  
  - title: "Temporal Profiling and Orderfile Optimization for Mobile Apps"
    speaker: "Ellis Hoag"
    video_url: "https://youtu.be/yd4pbSTjwuA"
    slides_url: "/devmtg/2024-04/slides/TechnicalTalks/Hoag-TemporalProfiling-and-OrderfileOptimization-forMobileApps.pdf"
    description: |
      Traditional PGO can improve CPU-bound applications, but it doesn't work
      well for some mobile applications which are more concerned with startup
      time and binary size. We recently extended LLVM's IRPGO framework to
      support Temporal Profiling to measure an app's startup behavior. We've
      also created a new algorithm to generate orderfiles called Balanced
      Partitioning which uses temporal profiles to reduce .text section page
      faults during startup and can even reduce compressed binary size. And
      finally, we have a tool to measure an iOS app's page faults on a device to
      showcase our results. This talk will be useful to anyone interested in
      understanding how IRPGO can order functions to improve start performance
      and compressed size.

  - title: "Enable Hardware PGO for both Windows and Linux"
    speaker: "Wei Xiao"
    video_url: "https://youtu.be/l-pauXcCz5k"
    slides_url: "/devmtg/2024-04/slides/TechnicalTalks/Xiao-EnablingHW-BasedPGO.pdf"
    description: |
      In this talk, we will discuss how to enable hardware PGO by extending
      sampling-based PGO with enriched profiles. We will postmortem some real
      cases to demonstrate hardware PGO can expose more optimization
      opportunities than instrumentation-based PGO and thus provide better
      performance. Moreover, we will discuss how to enable hardware PGO on
      Windows based on the latest Intel VTune SEP.
  
  - title: "Swift/C++ Interoperability"
    speaker: "Egor Zhdan"
    video_url: "https://youtu.be/2g-fQd_OYUU"
    slides_url: "/devmtg/2024-04/slides/TechnicalTalks/Zhdan-SwiftCPlusPus-Interoperability.pdf"
    description: |
      Swift/C++ interoperability enables incrementally incorporating Swift - a
      memory-safe language - into existing C++ codebases and has been used to
      gradually adopt Swift in large C++ projects, including the Swift compiler
      itself.

  - title: "Leveraging LLVM Optimizations to Speed up Constraint Solving"
    speaker: "Benjamin Mikek"
    video_url: "https://youtu.be/MHnScvWl67U"
    slides_url: "/devmtg/2024-04/slides/TechnicalTalks/Mikek-LeveragingLLVMOptimizations-toSpeedUp-ConstraintSolving.pdf"
    description: |
      SLOT is a new tool which uses existing LLVM optimization passes to speed
      up SMT constraint solvers like Z3. Our strategy is to translate SMT
      constraints into LLVM IR, apply the optimizer, and then translate back. We
      find that SLOT speeds up average solving times by up to 2x for
      floating-point and bitvector constraints, and increases the number of
      constraints solved at fixed timeouts by up to 80%.

  - title: "Structured Code Generation From the Ground Up"
    speaker: "Alex Zinenko"
    video_url: "https://youtu.be/E1QWiJUvw7I"
    slides_url: "/devmtg/2024-04/slides/TechnicalTalks/Zinenko-Vasilache-StructuredCodeGeneration.pdf"
    description: |
      Native high-level code generation support in MLIR is largely based on
      structured code generation. This talk demystifies structured code
      generation in MLIR by introducing relevant concepts bottom-up from
      individual arithmetic operations on scalars, to SIMD operations on
      vectors, to manipulations on multi-dimensional tensors. Examples and
      illustrations show that this approach boils down to concepts present in
      modern hardware, though with slightly different terminology.

  - title: "Contextual Instrumented-Based Profiling for Datacenter Applications"
    speaker: "Mircea Trofin"
    video_url: "https://youtu.be/jwkcmS52btI"
    slides_url: "/devmtg/2024-04/slides/TechnicalTalks/Trofin-ContextualInstrumented-Based%20ProfilingforDatacenter.pdf"
    description: |
      We present an Instrumentation-Based Profile Guided Optimization (PGO)
      technique that produces contextual profiles. This technique proves
      competitive with tip-of-tree instrumented PGO in binary size, runtime,
      memory overhead, and profile size when applied to a real production
      binary. We conclude with challenges and approaches to incorporating
      contextual profiles into LLVM.

  - title: "Faster Compilation with GlobalISel: Skipping LLVM-IR"
    speaker: "Tobias Stadler"
    video_url: "https://youtu.be/UYPBVel_OLg"
    slides_url: "/devmtg/2024-04/slides/TechnicalTalks/Stadler-FasterCompilation-With-GlobalISel.pdf"
    description: |
      In a GlobalISel-based backend, LLVM-IR is translated to generic Machine IR
      (gMIR), which is then selected into target instructions. This talk covers
      emitting gMIR directly, skipping the LLVM-IR generation and improving
      compile-times by ~20%. The presentation will explore working with gMIR,
      how common IR constructs are lowered for GlobalISel, and discuss LLVM's
      instruction selectors' performance.

  - title: "Incremental Symbolic Execution for the Clang Static Analyzer"
    speaker: "Balázs Benics"
    video_url: "https://youtu.be/bCr2Rw7UpBI"
    slides_url: "/devmtg/2024-04/slides/TechnicalTalks/Benics-IncrementalCSA.pdf"
    description: |
      This talk presents a technique to speed up subsequent Clang Static
      Analyzer (CSA) runs on mostly unchanged code. CSA takes more time to
      complete than simply compiling the source code, which poses challenges for
      quick developer feedback. We propose a method to reuse bulk analysis for
      incremental and localized changes, only re-analyzing changed parts that
      matter.
